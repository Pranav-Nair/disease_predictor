Don't smoke: Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, so the most important step you can take to prevent lung cancer is to not start smoking or quit smoking if you are a smoker.
Avoid secondhand smoke: Secondhand smoke can also increase the risk of lung cancer. Avoid being in areas where people smoke, and encourage smokers to quit.
Protect yourself from radon: Radon is a colorless, odorless gas that is the second leading cause of lung cancer. Test your home for radon and take steps to reduce radon levels if necessary.
Limit exposure to carcinogens: Avoid exposure to chemicals such as asbestos, diesel exhaust, and certain metals that are known to cause lung cancer.
Eat a healthy diet: A diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help reduce the risk of lung cancer. Avoid processed and red meats, and limit alcohol intake.
Exercise regularly: Regular physical activity can help reduce the risk of lung cancer. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise on most days of the week.
Protect your lungs: Protect your lungs from environmental pollutants by wearing a mask or respirator when working with chemicals or dust.
Get screened: If you are at high risk of developing lung cancer, talk to your healthcare provider about screening. Lung cancer screening involves a low-dose CT scan to detect early signs of lung cancer.
